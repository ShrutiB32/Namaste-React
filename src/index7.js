//part 1
//we will study of class based components : it is the older way of creating components  whereas functional components is the newer way to create components.
//so to check the difference between the functional and class based component creation we create User.js file where we create both type card to display the details about people (go to User.js) where we create functional based component and now we create the same componenet in class based component in UserClass.js
//at the end of the day functional based component is nothing but the normal js function and so evn class based component is the normal js class
//so to create the class based component check userclass.js file

//part-2
//next is creating a state variable in the class based component i.e userClass.js and in function based component i.e user.js

//part 3
//if we want to update the state variable in the class based component then how to do ?
